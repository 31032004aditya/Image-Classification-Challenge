* PLATFORM - KAGGLE

## OVERVIEW OF TASK:
### Clock Drawing test(CDT):
The CDT is a proven preliminary
test for detection of
neurocognitive diseases like
dementia. The patient is given a pen
and a paper and he is asked to
draw an analog clock on it and
show the time "11:10". Based on
how the patient draws, a medical
practitioner can detect the
chances of the patient suffering
from dementia.

### Goal:
We have to digitalise
the process of CDT by using deep
learning models utilising the
dataset of hand-drawn clock
images. Severity of the disease is
specified in range 0-5 (0
indicating the worst case and 5
showing no sign of dementia).

## APPROACH:
* Pretrained model
* Augumentation
* Hyperparameter tunning (learning_rate, step_size, gamma)
* loss function, optimization
* Ensemble method

## Model Selection:
We have tried different type of pretrained
models:
* Resnet
* Inception
* Densenet
* Efficientnet

## AUGMENTATION:
* Resize
* Random crop
* Horizontal flip
* Normalize
* Random rotation 90

## ENSEMBLE:
* Eensemble methods are techniques that create
multiple models and then combine them to
improved results.
